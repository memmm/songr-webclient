# SongR - webclient

## Startup

run `npm i` to install all dependencies (you can see what will be installed in package.json)
then `npm run dev`, and in a minute you can visit localhost:3000

We have three pages:

- index.js: main page with register/login
- chat.js: the chat window
- settings.js: for preferences

The pages share a layout (components/Layout.js).
